# TMSync

Translation Management Synchronization tool for any translation management service & platform.

## Installation

Simply run the following to install it:

    $ gem install tmsync

## Usage

Run TMSync simply by calling `tmsync execute` in the command line. The following options are **required**:

- `--path=` / `-p`: Specify the absolute path to search for localization files. Usually the root directory of your project.
- `--command=` / `-cmd`: Specify the command of your translation manager to download/upload a single translation file. `<LANGUAGE>` and `<FILE_PATH>` will be replaced by the according values.

In addition to the required fields you need to either specify a platform (currently supported: `ios`, `android`) **OR** you need to specify a matching regular expression as well as an exclusion regular expression yourself. Note that the matching regular expression needs to have a capture group which catches the language so you can access `<LANGUAGE>` in your command:
- `--platform=`: Preconfigured regexes for the iOS and Android platform. Specify `ios` or `android`.
- `--matching_regex=` / `-matching`: Specify a custom regex for matching the translation files in search. This should include a catch group for the language.
- `--exclude_regex=` / `-exclude`: Specify a custom for excluding some files that were found with the matching regex.

Here's a **complete example for iOS**:

```
tmsync execute --command="echo <LANGUAGE> <FILE_PATH>" -p "/absolute/path/to/project" --platform=ios
```

Here's a **complete example for Android**:

```
tmsync execute --command="echo <LANGUAGE> <FILE_PATH>" -p "/absolute/path/to/project" --platform=android
```

Here's a **complete custom example**:

```
tmsync execute --command="echo <LANGUAGE> <FILE_PATH>" -p "/Users/JamitLabs/Code/Apple/FitterYou" -matching ".*\/\S+\.(\S+)\.yml"
```
